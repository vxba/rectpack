This code implements Huang and Korf's (2008, 2009, 2010, 2011) optimal rectangle packer. It also implements Korf's (2003, 2004) and Korf et al.'s (2009) optimal rectangle packer.

The software handles rectangles rotated to be aligned to the x and y axes, handles both oriented and unoriented rectangles, rectangles of high-precision dimensions, and finds the bounding box of smallest area that can contain the input rectangles without overlap.
